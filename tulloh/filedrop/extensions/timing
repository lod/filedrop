Synchronize may be faster


Initial run - transferring all files 55.76s  > initial_run_log
Secord run - verifying existing files 65.10s > second_run_log
Slower!!

Podman container system doesn't support pipelining.
Which is a shame, it's something we really want to test and optimise for
Docker container link does support pipelining, worth it to switch

With docker installed pipelining is enabled
Initial run, 34.94s (60% faster than 55.76s)  - may be better, I think I added some files
Second run (verify, no changes) 37.13s (57% faster than 65.10s)
Second pass is still slower than initial run though
