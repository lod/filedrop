# Ansible Collection - lod.filedrop

This collection contains a single action, filedrop, that transfers a structured tree of files to a remote host.

This action coordinates directory creation, file copying, templates, permissions management and fine grained handler notification all in one. It can be configured through in-tree directory management files or via the `path_re` task argument.

Documentation for the action is available at https://lod.github.io/filedrop/filedrop_module.html

This collection is not yet published on ansible galaxy.
